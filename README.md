# Dental Image Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Dental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, with dental diseases affecting a significant portion of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis is key to effective treatment and management. In recent years, advancements in digital imaging and machine learning have opened new avenues for enhancing diagnostic processes in dentistry. Among these, panoramic dental X-rays stand out as a comprehensive method for examining the entire dental arch.

However, the interpretation of these X-rays is not without challenges. It requires significant expertise and is subject to human error, with the potential for variability in diagnostic outcomes. Automating the analysis of dental X-rays through machine learning can aid in reducing these errors, standardizing interpretations, and providing support for dental professionals.

### The Problem

This project is centered on the challenge of interpreting panoramic dental X-rays through the development of a machine learning model that can autonomously identify and classify individual teeth. Currently, dental professionals perform tooth-by-tooth examinations, where it is necessary to focus on one tooth (or a specific section of the mouth) at a time. The goal is to automate the extraction of individual teeth from panoramic X-ray images, thereby streamlining the diagnostic process.

### Motivation

The motivation for this endeavor is twofold: to augment the efficiency of dental examinations and to integrate with dental information systems effectively. In practice, dentists could benefit from a system that automatically crops and displays an image of a specific tooth, facilitating a focused evaluation. This capability would be particularly advantageous in dental information systems where patient data is stored, allowing for quick retrieval and display of individual tooth images as needed.

Such a system would not only expedite the diagnostic process but also serve as a dynamic educational resource for dental students, providing a standardized approach to studying dental anatomy and pathologies through radiographic images.

Moreover, the application of traditional machine learning methods, as opposed to deep learning, is deliberate. It aligns with the educational objectives of the course and challenges us to investigate the efficacy of these methods in image analysis â€” a field often dominated by neural networks. Further advancements and complications of the task can be made using more advanced algorithms like deep learning models.

The successful completion of this project will result in a prototype that not only showcases the practical application of machine learning in dental imaging but also sets the stage for future advancements in automated dental diagnostics.


### Objective

- Train a machine learning model to recognize different types of teeth.
